  - Mean (average)
  - Median
  - Mode
  - Variance
  - Standard Deviation
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.
- Instant results after submitting data.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the web application's content.
- **CSS**: For styling and enhancing the layout.
- **JavaScript**: For performing statistical calculations and handling user interactions.
